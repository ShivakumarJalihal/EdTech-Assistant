Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and code readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes the importance of programmer productivity and code clarity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is dynamically typed and has an automatic memory management system, which makes it a popular choice for scripting, web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.
